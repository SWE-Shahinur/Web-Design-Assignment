        <h3>Hyaluronic acid benefits your skin</h3>
        <img src="img1.jpg" height="300" width="500"><br>
        <b>Hyaluronic acid has recently become such a hyped ingredient, but the popularity is acceptable because 
        the ingredient provides what it claims to—anti ageing.</b>
        <p>The skin requires a certain amount of water for it to be healthy and look hydrated and radiant, but the
        skin tissues lose ability to retain the water with time and age resulting in the skin looking dehydrated 
        and dull. Dehydrated skin, then results in wrinkles and fine lines which automatically make your skin look
        old, and it losses its firmness too. This is where Hyaluronic acid steps in and works its magic. It is 
        basically an anti-ageing ingredient which does wonders for your skin. It revitalizes not only the outside
        layer of your skin but the tissues as well increasing the skin immunity, he says.</p>
        <i>It is an ingredient we have included in quite a few of our products here at Kiehl’s too because we want
         our consumers to fall in love with their skin every single day and HA will only make your skin look younger.”</i><br>
